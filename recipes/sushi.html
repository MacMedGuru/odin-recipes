    <h1>Sushi</h1>

        <img src="../images/sushi.jpg">

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Let’s dive right in!  It may seem like a lot to buy at first, but most of the ingredients turn into 
            staples [like sriracha + sesame seeds] and non perishables like nori, sushi rice, and vinegar will 
            last a ridiculously long time in your pantry.  You’ll end up with 4-6 sushi dinners for the price of 
            one at a restaurant.  But above all else, it’s really fun!  Invite a few friends over and go nuts.</p>

        <p>As a bonus, this is one of the few times it’s socially acceptable to say “Here’s everything you need, 
            now make your own dinner!”  Set out all your ingredients and let your friends & family create their 
            own rolls!</p>

        <p>I’ll walk you through each step in the post and then include a printable cheat sheet at the end to make 
            your new sushi adventure even easier!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>sushi rice (Nishiki is my brand of choice!)</li>
            <li>a bamboo mat</li>
            <li>plastic wrap</li>
            <li>nori</li>
            <li>low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>toasted sesame seeds and chia seeds</li>
            <li>sriracha chili sauce</li>
            <li>wasabi and pickled ginger</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine 1+1/2 cups of rice with 2 cups of water in a medium sized pot and bring to a boil.  Once 
                the water begins to boil, reduce heat to low and cover.  Let the rice simmer for 20 minutes, stirring 
                every 5 minutes or so.  Remove from heat after 20 minutes but let the rice stand, covered, for 10 
                minutes or so to ensure that the rice is fully cooked.  The best way to ruin the sushi is to roll it 
                in crunchy rice. I have TOTALLY done this before — whoops!  A taste test will ensure that your rice is 
                perfectly fluffy.</li>
            <li>If you don’t already own rice vinegar, feel free to opt for the pre-seasoned variety to save yourself 
                a step.  If you already have a bottle of rice vinegar or have white vinegar on hand, simply season with 
                salt and vinegar to taste.  For the rice measurements above you’ll need 1/3 cup of seasoned rice vinegar 
                or 1/3 cup of vinegar seasoned with one teaspoon of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  Pour over your rice, 
                fluff with a fork, and taste.  Adjust salt/sugar as desired.  Remove rice from heat, add to a bowl and 
                cover with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>While the rice cooks + cools – prep your veggies! Slice vertically into matchsticks and set aside. Once 
                the rice is done you’ll be ready to roll!</li>
            <li>To avoid messy clean-up and scrubbing, wrap your bamboo mat in plastic wrap.  Lay a sheet of nori on 
                top and grab your rice!</li>
        </ol>
